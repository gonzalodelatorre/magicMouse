During the lockdown  period, a friend of mine was complaning about how his boss went crazy when he saw his messaging tool status
red - even though he knows he has three little children - for ten minutes. He asked about if there was something he could do, so i decided to make this very simple program 
that moves the mouse constantly so that he is always online.
He was sos happy with the end result that he sent me some beers wich i really enjoyed, thanks tony!
